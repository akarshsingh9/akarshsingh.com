You can write regular [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) here and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:
 
| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |
 

How about a yummy crepe?

Here's a code chunk with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```
