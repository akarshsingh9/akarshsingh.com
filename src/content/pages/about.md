## Why set up this website?

I like learning in public, I have set up this website to write blogs about new skills that I have acquired or share my experience while working on some new projects. I like to maintain an online presence and have an uncluttered space on this internet to showcase my past projects and activities. 

## How I have set up this website?

I am using the Foundation starter template in Gatsby JS and the site is deployed using Netlify. I use VS Code as my default text editor for writings blogs and code for this website. 

The purpose behind choosing this template is to get started quickly with my website and learn how to create themes in Gatsby JS by modifying this template.

## The Process

After trying to build websites on different platforms like Wordpress, Hugo, Jekyll, and GatsbyJS, I finally decided to stick with GatsbyJS. When I was an undergrad student, I had built and maintained websites using WordPress. I get the appeal of using WordPress but the amount of time and money I had to invest in maintaining my college project [Code In Python](https://web.archive.org/web/20191205134205/http://codeinpython.com/) was not worth it. I was spending a lot of money on domain name renewal and server costs. I wanted a free alternative at least from the hosting side.

Static site generators are exactly what I was looking for. I compared a lot of options available, Hugo claimed to be the fastest SSG option. I spent the next four to six months learning and building my personal portfolio website on Hugo. Building a portfolio site in Hugo is easy but deployment was a pain. For some reason, few blogs were missing from my production site even though I had committed all changes in my GitHub repository. 

Then I thought I should try Jekyll. Installing Ruby and Ruby gem in Windows 10 environment is not easy and the experience of using Jekyll is not better than Hugo. 

Finally, I decided to switch to Gatsby JS. Proper documentation, coding style, gatsby plugins, templates, and the deployment process is easier to understand and implement when compared to other options I tried.
