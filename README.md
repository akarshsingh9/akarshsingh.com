# Akarsh Singh's Personal Website

This repo contains code for my personal website [https://akarshsingh.com](https://akarshsingh.com)

## How I got started ?

This site is built using Gatsby JS, React, Node.js and deployed using Netlify. I have used [`gatsby-starter-foundation`](https://github.com/stackrole/gatsby-starter-foundation) template as a starting point. I intend to customize this template to an extend that it becomes my personal theme for this website. Gatsby-starter-foundation theme is a minimal starter theme and check my future plans to customize this theme.

## My future plans for the website

I want to add following things to this website in future. These features are not currently available in my website.:
1. Portfolio / Project page to showcase my projects in GitHub.    :heavy_check_mark:
2. Twitter and Github Follow buttons
3. Home page to accomodate Project cards
4. Feature to share articles on social media
5. Experience and resume page
6. Twitter / Spotify integration if possible
7. Tags and categories on each post. Filter articles based on tags.
8. Search Post
9. Reading time on each post
10. Maybe remove pagination and have all articles in single page and add infinite scroll.
11. Patreon and Kofi support. GitHib sponsor.
12. RSS feed to be added.
13. Resume page with resume embeded in PDF format.    :heavy_check_mark:
